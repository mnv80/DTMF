# DTMF
DTMF Library for Arduino

Based on https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=121540.0;attach=191508
by El_Suprimo.  Changes:
 - Replace use of pin D4 to detect the sampling frequency with method dumpSamplingFrequency.
 - Change the button decode routine to be able to detect that a button is no longer pressed.
 - Add some debug methods.  
 - Cosmetic changes just to help my understanding.  They don't change the original behaviour.
